#CPU Utilisation

Processes can operate, take a break as another process takes its place
so as to avoid CPU idle time

GO routines are concurrent methods


#Concurrency & Parallelism

Parallelism - take one method and replicate across all CPU cores
Multi-threaded architecture across multiple cores


#Synchronous vs Asynchronous

Synchronous - functions process after the previous process has completed

Asynchronous - functions are running concurrently, so they are not waiting for other functions
This is achieved through inter-process communication (IPC)


#Channels
Problem arises when producer and multiple consumers need to be in sync with each other
Channels are queues with mutexes
Queue size of 1 means the producer can not produce another item until the item in the channel is consumed
Unbuffered channel

Buffered channel size > 1
